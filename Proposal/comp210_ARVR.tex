\section{Proposal}

The interface will be intergrated into one of the BA games currently in development in unity. 
In the game you play as a diver that has to use different types of fish to survive and complete tasks.

For the interface I plan to add hand controls to pick up fish within the game, and on your arm there will be status' of the players vitals, such as oxygen, health etc.

Possibly intergrate LeapMotion to capture hand gestures.

If I have access to a perception neuron body suit, that would be a good way to capture motion within the game.
